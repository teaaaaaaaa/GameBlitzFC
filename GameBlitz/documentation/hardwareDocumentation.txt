CPUs: an 8 mhz graphics processor and an 8 mhz audio processor, both are 16-bit.
RAM: 64kb of WRAM.
graphics: 240 x 200 frame buffer.
audio: 2 signed 16-bit PCM channels, one for the left channel and one for the right channel, that can go up to 24 khz (CPU driven).

Both CPUs share the same memory but have their own program counters.
once either CPU begins execution again it picks up where it left off. Both have their own registers.
the graphics processor starts operation at ROM address 0x00020000 and the audio processor starts operation at 0x00020008.
either the graphics processor is operating or the audio processor is operating, not both, so make sure their operations don't overlap.
if they do overlap, it may cause glitches, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
Additionally, the graphics processor cannot output audio. Attempting to do so will result in silence.

copy and copyT instructions:
these have unique functionalities, allowing blocks of data to be copied around. They're controlled by IO registers, and can copy up to 1 megabyte of data per frame.
if it's in the middle of drawing a row when it hits the limit, it will draw the row first then halt all data transfers (for performance reasons).
clipped pixels do not count towards the 1 megabyte data copy limit.
Scaled data will wrap around every 256 pixels. No more, no less.

The game blitz has a 32-bit address space, arranged as follows:
	0x00000000 - 0x0000FF7F: Work RAM
	0x0000FF80 - 0x0000FFFF: I/O
	0x00010000 - 0x000101FF: palettes
	0x00010200 - 0x0001BD7F: frame buffer
	0x0001BD80 - 0x0001FFFF: unused
	0x00020000 - 0xFFFFFFFF: ROM
	
	There are several registers in IO, here's what they do:
		
	0xFF80 - the fade to black register. All on-screen colors are subtracted from this register. There is no fade to white register.
	0xFF81 - copy and copyT instruction settings
	
	bit 0: 0 enables row mode while 1 disables it. In row mode, the copy destination automatically gets incremented by 240 minus the data size, for each row.
	bit 1: 0 disables horizontal scaling while 1 enables it.
	bit 2: 0 disables horizontal flipping, 1 enables it.
	bit 3: 0 disables vertical scaling, 1 enables it.
	bit 4: 0 disables vertical flipping, 1 enables it.
	
	0xFF82 - width of data to copy in pixels.
	0xFF83 - height of data to copy in pixels.
	0xFF84 & 0xFF85 - 15-bit horizontal scale register. Values smaller than 255 scale wider, values greater than 255 scale thinner.
	0xFF86 & 0xFF87 - 15-bit vertical scale register. Values smaller than 255 scale taller, values greater than 255 scale shorter.
	0xFF88 - X origin register.
	0xFF89 - Y origin register.
	0xFF8A - clip left register. If set, only pixels with an X offset greater than or equal to this value will be copied.
	0xFF8B - clip up register. If set, only pixels with a Y offset greater than or equal to this value will be copied.
	0xFF8C - absolute width. If greater than 0, this will override the source width, making it independent from the destination width.
	0xFF8D - unused
	0xFF8E & 0xFF8F - channel 1 (left only)
	0xFF90 & 0xFF91 - channel 2 (right only)
	0x0FF92 & 0xFF93 - controller inputs
	
	bit 0: left, d-pad
	bit 1: right, d-pad
	bit 2: up, d-pad
	bit 3: down, d-pad
	bit 4: start
	bit 5: select
	bit 6: A (bottom button)
	bit 7: B (right button)
	bit 8: X (left button)
	bit 9: Y (top button)
	bit 10: left bumper
	bit 11: right bumper
	0x0FF94 - mode
	0 - 8bpp mode
	in 8 bpp mode, the frame buffer is utilized without relying on WRAM.
	1 - 15bpp mode
	in 15 bpp mode, the frame buffer and the lower 48kb of WRAM (from 0x0000 - 0xBB7F) contain the upper and lower planes of 15bpp image data respectively. Use sparingly.
	(note that the fade register has no effect in 15bpp mode)
	2 - blend mode
	in blend mode, buffer 1 is located in the lower 48kb of WRAM. Each buffer's colors are halved and added with each other independently of the 15bpp limitation, allowing for translucency. Use sparingly.
	3 and beyond: invalid, trying to access these modes will cause the console to crash.
